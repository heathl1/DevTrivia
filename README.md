<h1>Welcome to DevTrivia!</h1>

Our project is a webâ€‘based Trivia Challenge Game designed to be fast, fun, and social. Players can jump in as guests or register to save progress, compete on leaderboards, and view a personal dashboard. Gameplay features three difficulty levels and multiple categories. We are building the application in Java using Spring Boot, with a responsive front end and a relational database to persist users, questions, results, and game sessions.
