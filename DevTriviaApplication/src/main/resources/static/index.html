    <!-- This page is the main starting point for my DevTrivia project. -->
    <!-- I am keeping it simple with just a title, a short tagline, and two buttons for navigation. -->

    <!-- I am linking to my CSS file here so I can style the page later if I want. -->
    <!--link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"-->

    <!-- I am setting a theme color for the browser tab area, just to make it look nicer. -->

<body>
<!-- This is the main title of my web app. I want it to be the first thing people see. -->
<h1>DevTrivia</h1>

<!-- This is a short line to describe what my app is about. -->
<p>Are you smarter than a Senior Dev?</p>

<!-- I am using two forms with buttons to simulate basic navigation for now. -->
<!-- The first form is for logging in, but it does not do anything yet because this is just a prototype. -->
<form action="index.html">
    <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>

<!-- I added this div with a height value so there is space between the buttons. -->
<div style="height: 25px;"></div>

<!-- This second form sends the player to the game page. -->
<!-- When the player clicks Play, the browser will go to game.html where the question appears. -->
<form action="/game.html">
    <button type="submit">Play</button>
</form>

<!-- Everything below this point could be expanded later when we add user accounts, -->
<!-- login functionality, and maybe difficulty levels or categories. -->
<!-- For now, this page just helps me test navigation between files. -->
