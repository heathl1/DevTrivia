<!-- I am using two forms with buttons to simulate basic navigation for now. -->
<!-- The first form is for logging in, but it does not do anything yet because this is just a prototype. -->

<!-- I added this div with a height value so there is space between the buttons. -->
<div style="height: 25px;"></div>

<!-- This second form sends the player to the game page. -->
<!-- When the player clicks Play, the browser will go to game.html where the question appears. -->
<form action="/game">
    <button type="submit">Play</button>
</form>

<!-- Everything below this point could be expanded later when we add user accounts, -->
<!-- login functionality, and maybe difficulty levels or categories. -->
<!-- For now, this page just helps me test navigation between files. -->
